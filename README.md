# Background

The purpose of gym_fishing is to develop RL agents that can simulate fisheries. Fisheries are areas where fishes are harvested for commercial years. However, there is an imminent problem with how these fisheries are carried out. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, over 33% of the world's fisheries are overfished, meaning that fish are caught and harvested more than they can reproduce. Overfishing is also related to bycatch, which is the capture of unwanted sea life (WWF). Overall, this negatively affects billions of sea animals and the ecosystems they live in. It is also important to note that fisheries are a principal component for the world's food industry and economy, and overfishing is a large cause in worldwide malnourishment.

# Setup
For Python setup, install the following dependencies:
```
python gym_fishing/setup.py sdist bdist_wheel 
pip install -e ./gym_fishing/
```
```
ls
cd gym_fishing
```
